<h3>Short Course Description</h3>
<p>A project-based introduction to statistical data analysis.
Through case studies, computer laboratories, and a term project,
students will learn practical techniques and tools
for producing statistically sound and appropriate, reproducible, and verifiable 
computational answers to scientific questions. 
Course emphasizes version control, testing, process automation,
code review, and collaborative programming.
Software tools may include Bash, Git, Python, and LaTeX.</p>
<h3>Overview and Longer Course Description</h3>
<p>This is a project-based course that introduces you to reproducible and
collaborative statistical research, applied to a real scientific question.  You
will gain experience acquiring, cleaning, and curating data; formulating
scientific questions statistically; developing appropriate statistical methods
to analyze the data to answer the scientific questions; implementing those
methods in robust, testable, reusable, extensible software; applying the
methods; visualizing the results; interpreting the results; and communicating
the results to others. And you will learn to do this in a way that is
computationally reproducible, which is increasingly recognized as key to
scientific progress.</p>
<p>As if you were working in a scientific research group or in industry, you will
be given a set of tools (a “software stack”) and practices you are required to
master and use. As if you were working in a scientific research group or in
industry, you will be pointed to resources to help you learn the tools, and it
is your responsibility to ensure that you have mastered them, which will
require a substantial amount of time outside class. And, as if you were working
in a scientific research group or in industry, you will be required to
collaborate and to take responsibility for your role in the collaboration. </p>
<p>But the point is not merely to master the tools or to learn to collaborate
effectively.  Rather, the point is to do sound computational science, and to do
it in a way that others can verify the data and statistical techniques behind
your analysis, can verify that your code does what it’s supposed to do, can run
the code using the data and parameters you used, can verify that they get the
same results you do, and can build on what you have done to advance science
even further. </p>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>Three hours of class per week in two 90-minute sessions, plus two hours of labwork.
Class sessions are divided between lecture and collaborative work. To a large
extent, the class is “flipped,” meaning that you are responsible for watching
video lectures and working through online tutorial materials—outside class—as
well as collaborating with your team outside class, so that a substantial
amount of class time can be devoted to group work on the project, including
frequent in-class presentations by students, code reviews, brainstorming, etc.
Students are expected to work at least eight hours per week outside class, making
this a 4-unit course (thirteen hours of effort per week).</p>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Statistics 133, Statistics 134, and Statistics 135 (or equivalent).
{{ prereq }}</p>
<h3>Restrictions</h3>
<p>{{ restrict }}</p>
<h3>Grading</h3>
<p>10% quizzes, 20% labs, 30% homework, and 40% group project</p>
<p>For the first half of the course, there will be a number of homeworks to ensure
the students are mastering the basic computational skills necessary to complete
their final group projects.  The group projects will be the primary focus for
the last half of the semester.  There will be regular milestones that will
involve code submissions, code review, and short presentations.</p>
<p>Starting in week 8, the pattern of class will alternate weekly between
producing and presenting and checking. There will be a week of science, code
development, and occasional new material, followed by a week in which students
make short presentations about what their team did on Tuesday, and then a
cross-team code review and check for reproducibility on Thursday. </p>
<p>{{ rubric}}</p>
<p>All work will be done using the version control system Git. The Git repository
is not merely a mechanism for submitting work, but the way you will work with
code and text throughout the course. You will be expected to become a Git
expert by the end of the course. You are expected to make consistent
contributions.  Procrastination is not rewarded.</p>
<h3>Textbook</h3>
<p>Readings will be assigned weekly and will mostly consist of articles and
tutorials.  Examples of the assigned articles are listed below.  Assigned
tutorials will vary per semester, but there will be an emphasis on using
official project documentation.</p>
