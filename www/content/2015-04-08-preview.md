This is the homepage for a new 4-unit course at UC Berkeley titled
**Reproducible and Collaborative Statistical Data Science** offered
by the Department of Statistics for the fall of 2015.

The course is based on the Stat 157 that was offered in
[Fall 2013](https://github.com/stat157/fall-2013) and
[Fall 2014](https://github.com/ucb-stat-157/fall-2014-public).

The class will be offered jointly to undergraduates (Stat 159)
and graduate students (Stat 259).  Graduate standing is required to register
for Stat 259.

Stat 133, 134, and 135 are prerequisites.
