This site is the homepage for a new 4-unit course a offered by UC
Berkeley's Department of Statistics in Fall 2015.

The course is based on the Stat 157 that was offered in
[Fall 2013](https://github.com/stat157/fall-2013) and
[Fall 2014](https://github.com/ucb-stat-157/fall-2014-public).

In Fall 2015, the class will be offered jointly to undergraduates (Stat 159)
and graduate students (Stat 259).  Graduate standing is required to register
for Stat 259.

Stat 133, 134, and 135 are prerequisites.

The content and syllabus will evolve over the summer, but here is the current
draft of the [Stat 159 syllabus](|filename|/files/stat159-syllabus.pdf) and
[Stat 259 syllabus](|filename|/files/stat259-syllabus.pdf).
