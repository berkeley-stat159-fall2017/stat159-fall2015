Title: UC Berkeley's Statistics 159/259 (Fall 2015)
Slug: projects

## Reproducible and Collaborative Statistical Data Science

For the first half of the semester we will have a series of short projects.

For the last half of the semester we will be focused on analyzing data from 
functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) experiments.  FMRI allows
scientists to localize which parts of the brain are associated with
specific cognitive tasks.  There is no expectation that you will have
a background in neuroscience.  You will learn everything you need to
know about the method in the course.  The intention of focusing on
fMRI data is merely to provide a concrete problem domain that exemplifies
the types of programming and statistical challenges present in many
statistical applications.

The weekly labs will prepare you---through a series of graded
exercises---with the skills and background you will need to complete
your final project.

## Individual Projects

### Twitter I (Weeks 1-3)

**Learning objectives:**  Working with the UNIX commandline (e.g., navigating
the filesystem, scheduling jobs with cron); RESTful APIs; JSON data formats;
Python datastructures (e.g., strings, lists, dictionaries); Python control
flow and list comprehension; basic numerical computing with NumPy and plotting
with matplotlib.

### Genetics (Weeks 4-5)

Case study looking at the Duke/Potti scandal.

**Learning objectives:** Data cleaning and EDA (e.g., PCA), understanding the
danger of using Excel, cross-validation, t-tests, more numerical computing
and plotting.

### Twitter II (Weeks 6-8)

Build on another teams Twitter I project.

**Learning objectives:**  Collaborative programming and workflows.

## Stat 159 group project

### Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) (Weeks 9-15)

**Learning objectives:** Working with complex and large datasets; convolution
(hemodynamic modeling, smoothing); interpolation (slice time correction,
image resampling); optimization (registration, advanced statistics);
basic linear algebra (statistics).
